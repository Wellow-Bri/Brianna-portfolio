    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi! My name is <strong>Brianna Wellow Muhor</strong>, a passionate web developer from Nairobi, Kenya. 
    I’m deeply driven by the desire to use technology to solve real-world problems in my community and beyond.
    As a curious learner and a creative thinker, I believe in the power of tech to transform lives — from 
    simplifying communication and improving education to revolutionizing healthcare and agriculture.
  </p>
  <p>
    My journey into tech is guided by a love for innovation, and I’m excited to keep learning, building, and 
    contributing meaningful solutions that make the world better, one project at a time.
